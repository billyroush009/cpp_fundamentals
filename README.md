# C++ Basics

## Code
This contains roughly two-dozen examples of core concepts and techniques used within the C++ language. Different sections are broken up by a block of comments starting with:

### Setup:
I created this in Visual Studio Code using the GCC compiler G++

#### Description:
I made this program to learn the fundamentals of C++, it covers the following topics:

Hello World, Variables, Data Types, Strings, Numbers, User Input(s), simple addition calculator, mad lib string example, arrays, functions, return statements, if statements, calculator w/ user chosen operation, switch statements, while loops, guessing game, for loops, exponent function, 2d arrays and nested loops, pointers, classes & objects, constructor functions, object functions, getters & setters, inheritance

## main.cpp:
This is the main file that this program uses. Above the "main()" function are all the stubs for functions used throughout the program, all of them are actually built below main. Also above the main function are the classes used to demonstrate the "class", "constructor", "getters and & setters", and "inheritance" sections of the program. The rest is one continuous block that all runs at once out of the "main" function. There is very little validation, this was primarily made for me to learn the concepts and not as any sort of end-product
